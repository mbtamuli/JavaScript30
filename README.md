## Day Log

### Day 1 - September 30, 2019

Live Link - [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://mriyam.dev/JavaScript30/CompletedChallenges/01-js-drum-kit/)

**Thoughts**: 
Learned about [`keydown` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keydown_event), [`transitionend` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/keydown_event) and little bit about the [`audio` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio).

### Day 2 - October 1, 2019

Live Link - [JS and CSS Clock](https://mriyam.dev/JavaScript30/CompletedChallenges/02-js-and-css-clock/)

**Thoughts**:
Learned about CSS [`transform`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform), the JavaScript method [`setInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) and a little bit about the global object [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

Apart from learning these, made a modification to the clock, added the clock
numbers as an SVG, then played around with the `width`, `top` and `left`
properties of the hour, minute and second hands to have a better looking clock.
Better being relative. ðŸ˜†

### Day 3 - October 2, 2019

Live Link - [CSS Variables](https://mriyam.dev/JavaScript30/CompletedChallenges/03-css-variables/)

**Thoughts**:
Woah, I wasn't even aware vanilla CSS had variable support(in whatever way). But I learned it today. ðŸ˜Ž 
I also learned about the [`:root` CSS element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) and that in JavaScript it can be referenced by [`document.documentElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/documentElement). Also used [`dataset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLOrForeignElement/dataset) attributes to set the suffix for each CSS property modified by the inputs.
